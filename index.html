                English Literature refers to the study of texts from around the
                world, written in the English language. By studying a degree in
                English Literature, you will learn how to analyze a multitude of
                texts and write clearly using several different styles.
                Generally, literature refers to different types of text
                including novels, non-fiction, poetry, and plays, among other
                forms. However, literature is a contested term, as new mediums
                for communication provide different types of contemporary
                literature.

                The Renaissance was a fervent period of European cultural,
                artistic, political and economic “rebirth” following the Middle
                Ages. Generally described as taking place from the 14th century
                to the 17th century, the Renaissance promoted the rediscovery of
                classical philosophy, literature and art. Some of the greatest
                thinkers, authors, statesmen, scientists and artists in human
                history thrived during this era, while global exploration opened
                up new lands and cultures to European commerce. The Renaissance
                is credited with bridging the gap between the Middle Ages and
                modern-day civilization. It is also callen 'Elizabethan Era'.

                The term Renaissance, deriving from the French for “rebirth,” is
                a name retroactively bestowed by 19th-century thinkers, who
                distinguished the era by its revivals: a renewed interest in
                ancient languages, the recovery of antique manuscripts, and the
                return to the classical ideals underlying the era’s defining
                intellectual movement, Renaissance humanism. Greek and Roman
                models, renovated for modern purposes, were especially crucial
                for poets defining or defending their art.

                The English theatre scene, which performed both for the court
                and nobility in private performances and a very wide public in
                the theatres, was the most crowded in Europe, with a host of
                other playwrights as well as the giant figures of Christopher
                Marlowe and William Shakespeare. Elizabeth herself was a product
                of Renaissance humanism trained by Roger Ascham, and wrote
                occasional poems such as "On Monsieur's Departure" at critical
                moments of her life. William Shakespeare, whose works include
                Hamlet, Romeo and Juliet, Macbeth, and A Midsummer Night's
                Dream, remains one of the most championed authors in English
                literature. The playwright and poet is widely regarded as the
                greatest dramatist of all time. Philosophers and intellectuals
                included Thomas More and Francis Bacon.

              William Shakespeare (1564-1616) was an English poet, playwright,
              and actor. Shakespeare is widely regarded as the greatest writer
              in the English language and the world's pre-eminent dramatist. He
              wrote about 38 plays, 154 sonnets, two long narrative poems, and a
              few other verses, of which the authorship of some is uncertain.

              Christopher Marlowe (1564-1593) was an English playwright, poet,
              and translator of the Elizabethan era. His work, particularly, the
              play The Tragicall History of Doctor Faustus, secured his lasting
              legacy. His achievement had a great impact on William Shakespeare,
              who was born in the same year as Marlowe.

              Thomas More (1478-1535) was an English statesman and writer of the
              early 16th century. More was an educated man. He studied at Oxford
              and qualified as a lawyer. He wrote Utopia, published in 1516,
              which describes the political system of an imaginary island state.
